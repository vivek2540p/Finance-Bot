These reports should contain the required financial statements.\\n2.  **Financial Results on BSE:** The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) website provides quarterly and annual financial results for Reliance Industries.\\n3.  **Trendlyne:** Trendlyne also offers financial statements, including balance sheets, profit and loss statements, and cash flow statements, for Reliance Industries with a 15-year history.\\n4.  **Smart-Investing:** Smart-Investing provides financial statement analysis, including key metrics and last 5 years annual financial results.\\n\\nI will now proceed to find the links to these resources and attempt to extract the financial data for the past 5 years. I will focus on the annual reports and financial results available on the official exchange websites and Trendlyne, as these are likely to be the most reliable sources.\"]}"

Due to the nature of the available tools, I can only provide information gleaned from web searches and not live financial data.\\n\\n**Debt Levels:**\\n\\n*   **High Debt historically:** Reliance Industries has had high debt levels in the past due to aggressive expansion, particularly in developing the Jio network. In 2020, their debt was reported at ₹346,196 crores.\\n*   **Recent Trends:**\\n    *   As of September 2024, net debt (excluding spectrum liabilities, capex creditors and lease liabilities) remained around INR 1,164 billion (similar to March 2024: INR 1,163 billion).\\n    *   Their net leverage (net debt to EBITDA) was reported as robust at 0.67x in 1HFY25 (FY24: 0.71x).\\n    *   A recent report indicates Reliance is seeking up to $3 billion in loans for refinancing, marking a return to the offshore market since 2023.\\n    *   ICICI Direct reported net debt as of March 31, 2023, as Rs 1,10,218 crore (USD 13.4 billion).\\n\\n**Key Asset Holdings:**\\n\\n*   **Fixed Assets:** Fixed assets, including property, plant, and equipment, are a significant part of Reliance's operational infrastructure, valued at Rs. 9,66,458 crore.\\n*   **Total Assets:** The total assets of Reliance Industries were approximately 17.6 trillion Indian rupees in 2023.\\n*   **Portfolio Holdings:** Reliance Group publicly holds 22 stocks with a net worth of over Rs. 118,358.0 Cr (as of December 31, 2024).\\n*   **Reliance Global Corporate Security:** Provides security to assets of Reliance Industries.\\n\\n**Liabilities:**\\n\\n*   **Total Liabilities:** Reliance Industries' total liabilities were over 8 trillion Indian rupees in fiscal year 2024.\\n*   **2023 Liabilities:** In 2023, liabilities amounted to 8.3 trillion Indian rupees.\\n\\n**Changes Over Recent Years:**\\n\\n*   **Revenue:** Relatively flat revenue year-on-year (8.91tn to 9.14tn).\\n*   **Net Income:** Net income grew 4.38% from 667.02bn to 696.21bn.\\n*   **Cost of Goods Sold:** Reduction in the cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales from 71.84% to 68.99%.\\n*   **Net Worth:** Reliance Industries has a net worth of 6.6 trillion rupees in the financial year 2023.\\n\\n**Important Considerations:**\\n\\n*   The information gathered is from various sources and may have different reporting periods or definitions.\\n*   For precise, up-to-date figures, consult Reliance Industries' official financial reports.\\n*   Credit rating agencies like India Ratings provide detailed analyses of Reliance's debt and financial performance.\"]}\n",
      "execute_step: {'past_steps': ['Okay, here\\'s an analysis of the current market sentiment towards Reliance Industries, considering recent news, analyst ratings, and leadership announcements:\\n\\n**1. Recent News Articles:**\\n\\n*   The Yahoo Finance News API yielded no recent news specifically for the \"RELIANCE.NS\" ticker. This suggests there aren\\'t any major breaking headlines readily available through that source.\\n\\n**2. Analyst Ratings:**\\n\\n*   MarketScreener.com suggests an improvement in analyst opinion recently.\\n*   Trendlyne indicates that Reliance Industries Ltd. has an average target price of 1516, representing a potential upside of 22.33% from a last price of 1239.30. However, it also mentions a downgrade from at least one broker.\\n\\n**3. Major Leadership Announcements/Changes:**\\n\\n*   Reliance is undergoing a strategic leadership transition, with Mukesh Ambani highlighting this shift.\\n*   Ira Bindra has been appointed as Group President of People, Leadership, and Talent. This is a significant move as she is the first non-family woman and the youngest member to join Reliance\\'s executive committee. This signals a change in HR and talent management approaches.\\n\\n**4. Sentiment and Potential Influences:**\\n\\n*   **Positive Sentiment Factors:**\\n    *   **Analyst Target Prices:** The average target price suggests analysts generally see potential for growth.\\n    *   **Leadership Transition:** The planned leadership transition, with Mukesh Ambani still involved, could be viewed positively as a sign of stability and long-term planning.\\n    *   **New HR Leadership:** The appointment of Ira Bindra could be interpreted as a forward-thinking move to modernize HR practices and attract/retain talent.\\n\\n*   **Negative Sentiment Factors:**\\n    *   **Broker Downgrade:** The mention of a broker downgrade on Trendlyne indicates some analysts have a less optimistic outlook.\\n    *   **No Recent News:** The lack of significant news headlines could mean the company is not currently in the spotlight, which might lead to investor apathy.\\n\\n**5. Potential Influences on Short-Term and Long-Term Prospects:**\\n\\n*   **Short-Term:**\\n    *   Analyst ratings and target prices can influence short-term trading activity. Positive ratings might lead to increased buying pressure, while downgrades could trigger selling.\\n    *   Major announcements (like leadership changes) can create short-term volatility as the market assesses the implications.\\n\\n*   **Long-Term:**\\n    *   The success of the leadership transition will be crucial. If the new leaders can maintain or improve upon Reliance\\'s performance, it will positively impact long-term prospects.\\n    *   The effectiveness of the new HR strategies under Ira Bindra will influence the company\\'s ability to attract and retain top talent, which is essential for long-term innovation and growth.\\n\\n**In conclusion:** The market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, driven by analyst target prices and the planned leadership transition. However, a broker downgrade and the need to successfully execute the leadership changes introduce some uncertainty. The appointment of a new HR leader signals a potential modernization of talent management practices, which could benefit the company in the long run.']}\n",
